# Tumor-Doppelg-nger-Studio
Similarity-first interpretability studio for breast tumor samples: pick a case, find its closest “twins” (benign/malignant look-alikes), visualize neighborhood structure, compare feature fingerprints, and run minimal-change counterfactual edits toward a target class. Educational demo only, not for diagnosis.
